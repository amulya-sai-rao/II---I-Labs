# Experiment 8
## Aim : Write a C++ program on Friend Class &Friend Function
### Step by Step procedure for the experiment
#### Friend Class
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h)

Step 2 - Create a class name 'B' for forward declaration.

Step 3 - Create a class name 'A' with the following class members. 'x' as a private data member and include the friend class B.

Step 5 - Create a class name 'B' with the following class members. 'y' as a private data member and display() as public member functions.

Step 6 - Access the value of x in class B using friend class.

Step 7 - Create a main() method.

Step 8 - Create the objects(a,b) of the above class A and class B respectively inside the main() method.

Step 9 - Call the display() using class object.
